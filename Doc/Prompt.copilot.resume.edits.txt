  CONTEXT: I've been working on a Document Management System (DMS) for 
   managing a
   Doc/ directory in git repos. The system is located at 
   ~/repos/scripts and has two active repos:

     - ~/Documents/MyWebsiteGIT/LLM/Doc (main testing repo)
     - ~/repos/scripts/Doc (new repo, just initialized)

   KEY FACTS ABOUT THE SYSTEM:

     - All scripts use hardcoded absolute path: Path.home() / 
   "repos" / "scripts"
     - Main entry point: dms command (interactive menu-driven)
     - Workflow: scan → image-to-text → summarize → review → apply
     - AI summaries are truncated to max 50 words
     - Images: OCR via tesseract, output to md_outputs/*.txt
     - PDFs: Either AI reads directly (if text-selectable) OR convert via dms 
   image-to-text (uses tools_pdf_to_md_textonly.py)
     - State files: .dms_state.json, .dms_scan.json (cleaned after apply), 
   .dms_pending_*.json
     - Index rendering: index.html with image viewer (displays images when 
   clicked)
     - Category suggestions: AI picks from existing list or suggests new ones
     - Image/text linking: OCR'd text files linked to original images with 
   "View Image" button

   SCRIPTS LOCATION:

     - Main wrapper: /Users/dennishmathes/repos/scripts/dms
     - Menu: /Users/dennishmathes/repos/scripts/dms_menu.py
     - Utilities: 
   /Users/dennishmathes/repos/scripts/dms_util/dms_*.py
     - Config: 
   /Users/dennishmathes/repos/scripts/dms_config.json

   CURRENT STATUS:

     - System is working and ready for daily use
